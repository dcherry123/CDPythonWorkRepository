# 2-7. Stripping Names: Store a persons name, and include some whitespace
# characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each
# character combination, \t and \n, at least once.
# Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed.
# Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions, lstrip(),
# rstrip(), and strip().

# strip function
name = "\tStripFunction\t"
name.strip()
print name

# lstrip function
name = "\tLStripFunction\t"
name.lstrip()
print name

# rstrip function
name = "\tRStripFunction\t"
name.rstrip()
print name
